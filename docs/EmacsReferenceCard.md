Below is a **clean, mechanical conversion of the GNU Emacs Reference Card** into **Markdown tables**, with **no slippage**, **no architectural commentary**, and **no Lexicon assumptions**.

I have:

* Preserved the **section structure** of the refcard  
* Listed **commands exactly as they appear conceptually**  
* Added **empty tracking columns only**  
* Avoided rewording unless required for table structure  
* Avoided adding or removing commands

You can now safely populate this offline.
